This is source code of temperature-moisture monitoring software, which I've made for my pharmacy shop.
Firstly I've achieve this with Raspberry Pi 4. After I accidentally broke Raspberry, I seek to made this setup with Intel Atom computer and arduino combo.
I revised python for arduino serial reading.
